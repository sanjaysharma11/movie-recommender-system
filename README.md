**By:** Sanjay Sharma 

## Technology Used

- **Python**
- **pandas**
- **ast**
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**

## Dataset

- **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset** (`tmdb_5000_movies.csv`)

## Overview

This mini project focuses on the development of a **category-based movie recommendation system** using Python and pandas. The system utilizes a real-world dataset of over 5,000 movies from **TMDB (The Movie Database)**, where genres are used as a basis for filtering recommendations.

The main objective of the project is to provide users with an interactive command-line tool to input a category (such as "horror" or "comedy") and receive popular movie suggestions relevant to that category. 

### Features

1. **Genre-Based Filtering**: The system allows users to input a genre (category) and filters movies accordingly.
2. **Popularity Sorting**: The movies are sorted based on their popularity, with the most popular ones displayed first.
3. **Paginated Output**: Movies are displayed in chunks of 10, and users can choose to view more movies if needed.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: The system parses and processes the movie dataset to extract genres and calculate the relevant results.
5. **Real-Time Interaction**: The system supports real-time filtering and handles user input interactively via the command line.

### Key Objectives

- Perform data parsing and genre extraction.
- Sort the movies based on popularity scores.
- Provide paginated output with the option to view more recommendations.
- Demonstrate real-time filtering logic and user interaction handling.
